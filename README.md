## Creately-Web-Development
This is an HTML code for a website homepage. The website is called "Creately" and it seems to be a tool for visual collaboration.

The code starts with some meta information for the website, including the author, description, and keywords. It also includes some links to external CSS files for styling, including Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

The body of the page starts with a container div that contains the navbar, a heading, and a hero section. The navbar has links to different sections of the page and a sign-up button. The hero section has two columns, one with a list of features and a call-to-action button, and the other with an animated graphic.

After the hero section, there is a section with customer logos and a footer.

Overall, the code seems well-organized and uses Bootstrap grid for responsive design.
